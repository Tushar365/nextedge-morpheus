# Fine tuning and testing of the model

fine_tune_phi_3_for_sentiment_analysis.ipynb contains the code to fine tune the model. Make sure to run it in colab and have the file synData.csv present in the same folder
At the end of training, part of the fine tuned model should be saved in a folder called trained_model in the same directory as the code.

To test the fine tuned model, try out Test_fine_tuned_phi_3.ipynb in colab
